# PDF Rancher

PDF Rancher is a versatile application designed for merging and splicing PDF files. While macOS users can rely on Preview for these tasks, Windows users often lack a comparable native solution. Although web services are available, they pose significant concerns regarding data sovereignty. PDF Rancher addresses this issue by providing a secure, offline tool for managing your PDF files. Unlike Adobe and Foxit, which charge a subscription at extortionary rates, PDF Rancher is completely free.
